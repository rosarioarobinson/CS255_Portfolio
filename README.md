# System Analysis and Design Portfolio for CS 255

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**


The DriverPass project focused on creating a new system for driving students who needed additional training outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles. The client was Liam, who is the owner of DriverPass. They noticed that there was a lack of good training programs for customers and wish to fill that void with DriverPass, both online and offline. Liam and his team wish for a system to be created that not only provides an online learning management system, but also provides options for customers to make reservations, gain feedback from their driving instructors, and is a cloud-based system.

**What did you do particularly well?**

Within each project, I believe that I was very detail-oriented and provided ample background of the components of the system from a business and UML perspective. Throughout the project, I have also taken feedback from my professor and other students on how to improve my work which I believe is another important component of well-produced documents.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

One part of my work I would revise would be within the system design document, specifically on the UML class diagram. I had the most challenges understanding how best to describe the correct attributes based on each class, so I believe that I could improve more in that section. The diagrams are an important aspect of understanding system analysis and design and continuing to improve on my understanding of UML diagrams is important as well.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

To interpret the user’s needs and implement this into the system design, being attentive to the interview transcript was one of the most important factors. For example, in the transcript, it was stated in detail how DriverPass wished for customers to be able to choose from multiple driving packages and the details of each package. This is an important part of the website design as well for the users when they log in. It is always important to consider the user’s needs when designing because they are an important part of *why* the system is being created. Keeping them in mind during both the designing and developing phases will allow for the best possible product outcome.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

One aspect of this course that allowed me to understand how to design software in the future is the use of UML diagrams. Being able to break down the system’s components into various diagrams allows me to see exactly what components of the system I need to consistently keep in mind during the development phase. I also believe that especially when working with companies, both small and large, having similar documents like the business requirements will provide both myself and the company with detailed information to further analyze and design the best system they need.
